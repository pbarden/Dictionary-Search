# Dictionary Search

Dictionary Search is a command-line tool written in Python to be used for processing dictionary data in JSON format (sample data included from Webster's Unabridged English Dictionary via Project Gutenburg). The user may enter a query in order to search the dictionary and display a stored definition. Suggestions can also be returned to the user via a mild variation of autocorrect which has also been implemented.
